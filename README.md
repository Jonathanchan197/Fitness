## Models
I first planned out the CRUD systems I would use and generated an ERD diagram to see the association models needed

### What I learned
1. Building CRUD systems
2. Associating models (One-many, Many-many)
3. Ruby and Rails proficiency
4. Nested forms
    - Checkbox based on current associations
    - Forms using builders by association
5. Improved CSS styling
6. Deploying a local project online via [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/)
7. User image-upload via [Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com/)

### To do
- [x] Cloudinary Image Upload
- [ ] Build second version with bootstrap
